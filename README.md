# Flask API Integration with JSONPlaceholder

This project is a Flask web application that integrates with the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch and display data from various endpoints. It demonstrates how to make HTTP requests, process JSON responses, and render data in HTML templates using Flask.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and Flask installed on your system. You can install Flask using pip:

```bash
pip install flask
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CaptainBett/flask-api-integration.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd flask-api-integration
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You can access different endpoints by appending the corresponding route to the base URL. For example:

- Users: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/users`
- Posts: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/posts`
- Comments: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/comments`
